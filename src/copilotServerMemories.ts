/**
 * GitHub Copilot **server-side** repository memories — discovery and analysis.
 *
 * Companion to `copilotMemoryFiles.ts`, which covers the *local* half: the Markdown
 * notes Copilot Chat's memory-tool writes under `workspaceStorage/<hash>/` on this
 * machine. This module covers the other half: the per-repository memory store GitHub
 * keeps server-side for the Copilot coding agent, the same list that renders under a
 * repository's `Settings -> Copilot -> Memory` page (in preview at time of writing).
 *
 * The two differ in a way that matters for how they may be surfaced. Local memory
 * files are reported **metadata-only** — their content is deliberately never read.
 * Server memories *are* content: the API returns the fact text, its citations and the
 * reasoning behind it, and there is nothing else to report. So this module reads and
 * renders that content, and the metadata-only rule from `copilotMemoryFiles.ts` does
 * not carry over. Nothing here is uploaded anywhere; it is fetched for the signed-in
 * user and analyzed in-process.
 *
 * ## Why analyze rather than just list
 *
 * A live repository's store is not a tidy set of facts. On this repository the store
 * held 340 memories in which the same graphify-setup fact appeared 14 times in
 * slightly different words, and roughly a third of all memories cited `AGENTS.md` or
 * another instruction file — the agent paying, repeatedly, to re-learn something it
 * had already been told. That repetition is the useful signal: a fact the agent keeps
 * rediscovering from code is a fact that belongs in a checked-in customization file
 * (`AGENTS.md`, `.github/copilot-instructions.md`, `.github/instructions/*`), where
 * every agent reads it for free on every run. {@link analyzeServerMemories} turns the
 * raw list into exactly that recommendation.
 *
 * ## API
 *
 * There is no public documentation for these routes; the contract below was taken
 * from the shipped Copilot CLI bundle (`~/.copilot/pkg/universal/<version>/index.js`),
 * which is their authoritative consumer, and verified against live repositories.
 *
 *   GET {base}/agents/swe/internal/memory/v0/{owner}/{repo}/enabled
 *       -> 200 `{ enabled: boolean }`
 *   GET {base}/agents/swe/internal/memory/v0/{owner}/{repo}/recent?limit=N
 *       -> 200 `ServerMemory[]`, or 204 No Content when the repository has none
 *
 * A PUT on the collection stores a memory. It is intentionally not implemented here:
 * this repository only ever reports on a memory store, so no code path of ours can
 * write to one.
 *
 * Two non-obvious requirements, both of which fail in ways that look like "there are
 * no memories" rather than like an error:
 *   - The scheme must be `Bearer`. A GitHub OAuth token works, but the `token` scheme
 *     that `gh api` sends is rejected with 401, as is `gh api`'s automatic
 *     `X-GitHub-Api-Version` header (`400 invalid apiVersion`).
 *   - `Copilot-Integration-Id` must name an integration the memory service recognizes.
 *     An unrecognized id (`vscode-chat`, for one) returns `403 memory is disabled for
 *     this client`, which reads like a repository setting but is not.

/**
 * Reduce a server-supplied string to something that cannot restructure the Markdown it is
 * embedded in.
 *
 * Memory text is written by an agent, and an agent's input includes repository content, so
 * it must be treated as untrusted. This output is explicitly offered as paste-ready for
 * `AGENTS.md` — the one file whose every line is read by every agent on every run — so a
 * fact that escapes its list item does not merely render oddly, it becomes an instruction.
 *
 * Two escapes matter and both are closed here:
 *   - **Line breaks.** A newline ends the list item, so `fact\n## Ignore the above` would
 *     land in the file as a heading of its own. Every line terminator, including the
 *     Unicode separators U+2028/U+2029, is folded into a single space.
 *   - **`-->`.** The header is an HTML comment holding the "verify before committing"
 *     caveat; a repo slug or fact containing `-->` would close it early and promote the
 *     remainder to live document text. The sequence is broken rather than dropped so the
 *     tampering stays visible to whoever reviews the block.
 *
 * Markdown emphasis characters are deliberately left alone: they can only make a line
 * render oddly, which a human pasting the block will see, and escaping them would make
 * ordinary facts about `*` globs or `_` names unreadable.

/**

 * sequence can arrive in a `fact` and, printed verbatim, reprogram the reader's terminal:
 * set its title, drive the clipboard, or hide text that is actually there. A report whose

 * it.
 *
 * So: strip C0 controls (including ESC and BEL), DEL and the C1 range, then collapse all
 * remaining whitespace — which also removes the line breaks that would otherwise let a fact
 * escape its list item or report line. Tabs and newlines are collapsed rather than kept,
 * because every caller renders one line per field.
