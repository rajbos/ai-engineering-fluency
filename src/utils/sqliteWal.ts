/**
 * Shared helper for reading a SQLite database file that may have an active
 * WAL (write-ahead log) sidecar.
 *
 * sql.js loads a database by reading raw bytes from the `.db` file only — it
 * has no concept of the `-wal`/`-shm` sidecar files SQLite uses in WAL mode.
 * When another process (e.g. the Copilot CLI) holds the database open in WAL
 * mode, its most recent writes live only in the `-wal` file until a
 * checkpoint merges them back into the main file. Reading just the `.db`
 * bytes in that window silently returns a stale snapshot — no error, just
 * missing recent rows/columns — until something else (e.g. the writer
 * closing its connection) triggers a checkpoint.
 *
 * `tryReadDbWithWal` works around this without a native SQLite dependency in
 * the extension's runtime: it copies the db + wal (+ shm) files to a temp
 * location, opens the copy with Node's built-in `node:sqlite` (Node.js 22+),
 * forces `PRAGMA wal_checkpoint(TRUNCATE)` to merge all WAL frames into the
 * temp file, and returns the resulting buffer for sql.js to load.
 *
 * This is a fallback path — callers with a native `node:sqlite` available
 * should prefer opening `dbPath` directly with `{ readOnly: true }`, which
 * sees pending WAL frames with zero copies (see src/cursor.ts). This module
 * still guards the copy-based approach for callers/environments that can't
 * do that: a size cap refuses to copy very large databases (see #2033, where
 * an unbounded copy of Cursor's 1-2 GB `state.vscdb` on every read filled
 * %temp%), and a per-path throttle with writer-activity backoff keeps a
 * continuously-written WAL from driving back-to-back merges.

/**

 * footprint it must bound is their sum, not the main db alone. The copy + native-open +
 * checkpoint + read-back is O(size) I/O and memory, and for a multi-GB pair (exactly the shape
 * that triggered #2033 — Cursor's `state.vscdb` routinely runs 1-2 GB on its own) that is worse
 * than reading a slightly stale plain `.db` file. Above this threshold `tryReadDbWithWal`
 * returns `null` so callers fall back to `fs.readFileSync(dbPath)` — a WAL-blind read that can
 * be stale, logged once per path below. Callers that need both cheap AND current reads for a
 * database this large should prefer the copy-free read-only `node:sqlite` backend instead (see
