# Copilot Token Tracker — Visual Studio Extension

![AI Engineering Fluency](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rajbos/ai-engineering-fluency/main/assets/AI%20Engineering%20Fluency%20-%20Transparent.png)

Tracks your GitHub Copilot token usage directly inside Visual Studio 2022+. Reads local Copilot Chat session files and displays usage statistics in a dedicated tool window.

> **Status**: Early access / active development. Core tracking is functional; some features available in the VS Code extension are still in progress.

## Install

The extension will be published to the [Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/vs). Until then, build from source (see [Contributing](../../CONTRIBUTING.md)).

---

## Features

- Token usage tracking from Visual Studio Copilot Chat session files
- Today's and monthly token counts displayed in a tool window
- Per-model usage breakdown

> **Note on token counts**: Visual Studio Copilot Chat session files store prompts and responses as plain text but do not include the actual LLM token counts used by the API. All numbers shown are **estimated** from prompt and response text length using model-specific character-to-token ratios.

## Screenshots

Features:

1. Toolbar with found token counts in the format `X | Y`
Which is today: X tokens | last 30-days: Y tokens

## Supported VS Versions

- Visual Studio 2022 (v17.x and later)

---

## Session File Location

Visual Studio Copilot Chat stores session files in:

```
<solution folder>\.vs\<solution name>.<ext>\copilot-chat\<hash>\sessions\<uuid>
```

The extension automatically discovers all sessions under the `.vs` folder for each open solution.

## Known Limitations

- Token counts are **estimated**, not actual LLM API counts. See the note above.
- Features available in the VS Code extension that are not yet available here:
  - **Cloud backend (Azure Storage sync).** The extension has no backend or sign-in
    path of its own — `backendConfigured` is only relayed from the CLI payload, so
    anything that needs GitHub auth or synced team data is unavailable.
  - **Views not shipped by this host**: Team Dashboard, Efficiency Trends,
    Log Viewer and What's New. (Show Team Dashboard falls back to the details
    view.)
  - **Diagnostic reporting panel.** The toolbar button is hidden and the
    diagnostics command redirects to the details view.
  - **Export dropdown (image / PDF / PPTX) and Share to Issue** on the Fluency
    Score view. Social sharing itself *is* supported — the LinkedIn, Bluesky and
    Mastodon buttons are handled by the Visual Studio host.
  - Sections and tabs that have no data in Visual Studio are hidden on the views
    that do ship: the Usage Analysis Dashboard hides the Workspace Health,
    Repository PRs, Cloud Agent, Insights and Recent Sessions tabs plus the
    Copilot Customization Files, Missed Potential and Repository Hygiene sections;
    the chart hides the By Repository toggle; the Fluency Score view hides the
    VS Code Marketplace MCP discovery button.
  - **Some controls render but do nothing.** Unlike the surfaces above these are
    not hidden, and the host has no handler for the commands they post:
    - The **Efficiency Trends** button in the toolbar of *every* view. It posts
      `showEfficiency`, which the host does not handle. (The Team Dashboard
      button beside it does not have this problem — the toolbar drops it when no
      backend is configured, which is always the case here.)
    - The **Worktrees** tab on the Usage Analysis Dashboard. `scanWorktrees`,
      `pickWorktreeRoot`, `deleteWorktree` and the cleanup commands are all
      unhandled, so scanning, picking a root and deleting are no-ops.
    - On the **Tool Output** tab, the Tool Curation section's "open" links and
      the suppress-tool control (`openFile`, `openFileFromList`,
      `manageExtension`, `openAgentPlugins`, `suppressUnknownTool`). Suppressing
      a tool updates the view but is not persisted.

  The Usage Analysis Dashboard, the AI Engineering Fluency Score and its Scoring
  Guide **are** available in Visual Studio, along with the details, chart and
  environmental impact views.
