# Tool Curation

## Overview

The Tool Curation feature analyzes the gap between the tools **available** in your environment and the tools **actually used** within a configurable look-back window. It surfaces actionable recommendations to reduce prompt overhead caused by idle MCP servers and stale skill files.

The curation section appears in the **Tools** tab of the Usage Analysis Dashboard.

## Why It Matters

Every MCP server and skill file contributes a description block to every prompt — even when the tool is never called. Over time, accumulating unused tools inflates prompt token counts, increases latency, and can hit context-window limits.

Tool Curation gives you a concrete view of which tools are pulling their weight and which ones can be safely disabled or refined.

## What Is Analyzed

### Available Tools (discovered on disk)

#### MCP Servers

The extension reads the following config files to build the list of configured MCP servers (checked in priority order, deduplicated by server name):

| Location | Scope | Editor |
|---|---|---|
| `<workspace>/.vscode/mcp.json` | Workspace | VS Code |
| `<workspace>/.mcp.json` | Workspace / repo root | Visual Studio |
| `<workspace>/.vs/mcp.json` | Solution-scoped | Visual Studio |
| `<workspace>/.cursor/mcp.json` | Workspace | Cursor |
| `%USERPROFILE%/.mcp.json` (Windows) / `~/.mcp.json` (macOS/Linux) | User-global | Visual Studio |

All files share the same JSON schema: `{ "servers": { "<name>": { ... } } }`.

#### Skill Files

Skill files (`SKILL.md`) are discovered from the following directories:

**Workspace-scoped** (relative to each workspace folder):

| Directory | Editor |
|---|---|
| `.github/skills/` | VS Code / GitHub Copilot |
| `.claude/skills/` | Visual Studio |
| `.agents/skills/` | Visual Studio |

**User-scoped** (in the home directory):

| Directory | Editor |
|---|---|
| `~/.copilot/skills/` | Visual Studio |
| `~/.claude/skills/` | Visual Studio |
| `~/.agents/skills/` | Visual Studio |

Each skill entry's description is extracted from the first `description:` line or `# Heading` in `SKILL.md`.

#### Extension/Runtime Tools

Tools registered via `vscode.lm.tools` at runtime are enumerated separately. MCP tools discovered this way are matched back to their server name via the `mcp__<server>__<tool>` naming convention.

### Used Tools (from session analysis)

Tool usage is counted from the look-back window configured via the **`aiEngineeringFluency.curation.timeWindowDays`** setting (default: 30 days, options: 7 / 30 / 90).

- **MCP server usage**: counted from `mcpTools.byServer` in the aggregated usage period
- **Tool call usage**: counted from `toolCalls.byTool` across all sessions in the window

## Recommendations

The curation analysis produces two types of recommendations:

### `disable-mcp-server`

Triggered when **zero** calls were made to any tool from an MCP server in the look-back window.

Includes an estimated token saving based on the combined description length of all tools from that server.

### `refine-skill`

Triggered when a skill file was **not invoked** during the look-back window. The recommendation suggests updating the skill's description (to improve discoverability) or removing it to reduce instruction-file bloat.

## Settings

| Setting | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `aiEngineeringFluency.curation.timeWindowDays` | `number` | `30` | Look-back window for determining "used" vs "unused" tools. Options: `7`, `30`, `90`. |

## Commands

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `aiEngineeringFluency.openMcpJson` | Opens the first MCP config file found in the workspace (checks `.vscode/mcp.json`, `.mcp.json`, `.vs/mcp.json`, `.cursor/mcp.json` and user `~/.mcp.json` in priority order; offers to create `.vscode/mcp.json` if none exist). |

## Architecture

The curation logic lives in `vscode-extension/src/toolCuration.ts`. The module is intentionally pure (no direct VS Code API calls) so it can be reused by the CLI.

| Function | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `enumerateRuntimeTools(tools)` | Converts `vscode.lm.tools` into `AvailableToolEntry[]` |
| `parseMcpJson(path)` | Parses a single `mcp.json` file and returns server names |
| `buildMcpEntriesFromJson(folderPaths)` | Discovers all MCP entries from all config locations |
| `discoverSkillEntries(folderPaths)` | Discovers all skill entries from workspace + home dirs |
| `analyzeToolCuration(available, usage, windowDays)` | Runs the full curation analysis |

Results are surfaced through:
- The **Tools tab** in the Usage Analysis webview (`src/webview/usage/main.ts`)
- The **Insights engine** (`src/insightsEngine.ts`) — adds `unused-mcp-servers` and `stale-skills` insight cards
- The **CLI** `curation` command (`cli/src/commands/curation.ts`)

## CLI Usage

```bash
copilot-token-tracker curation
copilot-token-tracker curation --json          # machine-readable output
copilot-token-tracker curation --days 7        # use 7-day window
```
