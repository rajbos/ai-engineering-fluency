description: Inventory hardcoded (non-localized) UI text across vscode-extension/src/webview/** and the webview-HTML-producing code in vscode-extension/src/extension.ts — string/template literals rendered as UI text that never go through localize()/localizeFormat()/t()/vscode.l10n.t(). Produces a human-triageable report; never fails the build. Use after a UI change, before a release, or periodically as a localization audit.

# Scan Hardcoded Strings Skill

Scans the VS Code extension's webview UI code for candidate hardcoded
(non-localized) UI strings and writes a triage report. This is an
**informational inventory tool**, not a CI gate — it never exits non-zero and
never modifies source files.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when you need to:
- Audit UI text after adding or changing a webview panel or a section of
  `extension.ts`'s `get*Html` methods, to catch strings that were typed
  directly instead of routed through localization
- Build or refresh a localization backlog before a release
- Periodically re-run as a maintenance/audit pass to see whether the backlog
  of non-localized strings is growing or shrinking
- Investigate a specific UI surface (e.g. a webview panel) that appears not
  to translate correctly under a non-English locale

It complements two existing scripts that only check *consistency* of strings
already wired through localization (`scripts/validate-localization.js` /
`npm --prefix vscode-extension run lint:l10n`, and
`vscode-extension/scripts/validate-l10n.mjs` /
`npm --prefix vscode-extension run validate:l10n`) — neither of those, nor anything else in the repo,
detects a plain string literal that never calls `localize(`/`t(`/
`vscode.l10n.t(` in the first place. A separate, stricter AST-based CI gate
for *new* instances of this may exist as an independent effort; this skill is
not that gate — it is a full-codebase inventory for manual triage.

## Running the Check

```bash
node .github/skills/scan-hardcoded-strings/scan-hardcoded-strings.js

# Machine-readable JSON output
node .github/skills/scan-hardcoded-strings/scan-hardcoded-strings.js --json
```

The script will:
1. Recursively scan every `*.ts` file (excluding `*.test.ts`) under
   `vscode-extension/src/webview/`, plus only the `get*Html(...)` method
   bodies in `vscode-extension/src/extension.ts` (not the whole 13k-line
   file — this keeps out unrelated string literals like GitHub issue
   Markdown templates or VS Code panel titles), after blanking out `/* ... */`
   block/JSDoc comments so example markup in a doc comment isn't mistaken
   for real UI text
2. Flag string/template literals in UI-rendering positions — assignments to
   `.textContent`/`.innerText`/`.innerHTML`/`.title`/`.placeholder` (a direct
   literal or a conditional/ternary RHS whose branches are literals),
   `aria-label="..."`/`title="..."`/`placeholder="..."` HTML attributes (or
   the same three set via `.setAttribute('title', '...')`), a literal
   `document.createTextNode('...')` argument, text inside `<div>`,
   `<button>`, `<vscode-button>`, `<label>`, `<h1>`–`<h6>`, `<p>`, `<span>`,
   `<td>`, `<th>`, `<option>`, `<summary>`, `<caption>`, `<li>`, `<title>`,
   and SVG's `<text>` tags in template literals (tolerating simple nested
   inline tags like `<a>`/`<strong>`/`<span>`, which are also matched as a
   literal's own root tag so e.g. `el.innerHTML = '<strong>Save
   changes</strong>'` isn't missed, and void/structural tags like
   `<input>`/`<br>` that never need a closing tag), and the UI-text argument
   of a known shared DOM helper call (`el(...)`, `iconHeading(...)`,
   `createButton(...)` from `vscode-extension/src/webview/shared/domUtils.ts`)
   — that argument may be several string/template literals joined by `+`,
   or a top-level ternary of (recursively) literal/`+`-joined branches, not
   just a single direct literal
3. Skip anything already wrapped in `localize(`, `localizeFormat(`, `t(`, or
   `vscode.l10n.t(`, and anything that doesn't look like prose (pure
   numbers/symbols, URLs, CSS values, HTML character references like
   `&middot;`/`&#8226;`, a narrow denylist of single CSS-keyword tokens — not
   every single lowercase word; the letter check itself is Unicode-aware, so
   non-English text isn't exempted) — but recover string literals that are
   themselves a whole ternary branch, or the fallback side of a `||` default,
   inside an interpolation's expression, e.g. `` `${flag ? 'Enable Overrides'
   : 'Disable Overrides'}` `` or `` `${msg || '<em>No message</em>'}` `` (a
   *plain* quoted literal that is merely an argument to some other call in
   the same interpolation, e.g. `` `${buttonHtml('btn-refresh')}` ``, is left
   alone — but a *template* literal there, e.g. `` `${escapeHtml(`${a} ·
   ${b} AIU`)}` ``, is still recovered, since a template literal builds
   display text while a plain quoted string is routinely a lookup key/id),
   checking each recovered literal on its own so one non-prose branch can't
   suppress another genuine one
4. Print a console report grouped by file, with line numbers and snippets
5. Write the same findings to `hardcoded-strings-report.md` at the repo root
6. Set `process.exitCode = 0` rather than forcing `process.exit()` — this
   script informs, it does not gate, and letting the process exit naturally
   avoids truncating buffered output when piped (e.g. in CI or `--json | ...`).
   Any unexpected error during the scan is caught and logged to stderr rather
   than crashing with a non-zero exit code, preserving that contract.

## Interpreting Output

Each finding shows the file, line number, which detector matched (the
"kind"), and a truncated snippet of the offending code. There is no severity
ranking — triage each entry:

| Situation | Action |
|---|---|
| Genuine hardcoded UI prose | Add a localization key and reference it via `localize()` (webview) or `t()` (extension host) |
| False positive (e.g. unusual formatting the regex misjudged) | No action — this is a line-scan, not an AST parse; use judgement |
| Text intentionally not localized (e.g. a raw model/tool name) | No action, but consider a code comment if the reason isn't obvious |

## After Finding Hardcoded Strings

1. Add the missing key:
   - Extension-host text (via `t('key')`): add it to
     `vscode-extension/package.nls.json` (+ `package.nls.zh-cn.json` where
     translated).
   - Webview text (via `localize('key')`): add it to `DEFAULT_LOCALIZATION`
     in `vscode-extension/src/webview/shared/localization.ts` (the English
     fallback) **and** to `getWebviewLocalization()` in
     `vscode-extension/src/extension.ts` (via `l10n.t('key')`) plus
     `package.nls.json` / `package.nls.zh-cn.json`. Without the
     `getWebviewLocalization()` entry, the webview always falls back to the
     English `DEFAULT_LOCALIZATION` text regardless of locale.
2. Replace the literal with a `t('key')` / `localize('key')` call at the
   flagged site.
3. Add test coverage per the repo's "Localization changes require test
   coverage" rule (`vscode-extension/test/unit/l10n.test.ts`).
4. Re-run this script to confirm the finding disappeared, then run
   `npm --prefix vscode-extension run lint:l10n` and
   `npm --prefix vscode-extension run validate:l10n` (both scripts live in
   `vscode-extension/package.json`, not the repo root) to confirm the new
   key is consistent across locale files.
