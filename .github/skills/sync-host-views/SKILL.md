description: Keep the Visual Studio and JetBrains webview views (screens) in sync with the VS Code views, while preserving the exact set of views each host ships. Detects views added to the VS Code extension (vscode-extension/esbuild.js entryPoints) that the Visual Studio host (AIEngineeringFluency.csproj) or JetBrains host (jetbrains-plugin/build.gradle.kts) do not yet ship, and surfaces them for a human decision instead of auto-adding. Use after building/updating the VS Code webviews, before a Visual Studio or JetBrains release, or whenever a host is missing a screen VS Code now has.

# Sync Host Views Skill

The VS Code extension owns **all** webview "views" (a.k.a. screens). The Visual
Studio extension and the JetBrains plugin are thin hosts that load a **subset**
of the same compiled webview bundles inside a WebView2 / JCEF browser.

Neither host commits webview content to git any more (see
`docs/adr/VS-WEBVIEW-BUNDLE-SOURCING.md`): both copy the bundles fresh from
`vscode-extension/dist/webview` at build time — Visual Studio via the
`.csproj`'s `CopyWebviewBundles` MSBuild target, JetBrains via
`prepareBundledAssets` in `build.gradle.kts`. So there is nothing left for this
skill to refresh or flag as stale; it only tracks **view-LIST drift** — which
named bundles each host's build config references — the same way for both
hosts:

- 🛑 **Never** silently add a new VS Code view to a host. New views are detected
  and **handed to the user to decide**.
- 🔎 Flag views a host references that VS Code no longer builds (orphans).

## One view == one screen

Each entry in the VS Code esbuild `entryPoints` map is exactly one webview bundle
and one user-facing screen. "Add a screen" therefore means "add a bundle to the
host include list **and** wire up navigation to it" — that is the human decision
this skill protects.

## The three sources of truth

| Role | File | Symbol |
|------|------|--------|
| **Canonical view set** (VS Code) | `vscode-extension/esbuild.js` | `entryPoints` keys mapping to `src/webview/<name>/main.ts` |
| **Built artifacts** | `vscode-extension/dist/webview/<name>.js` | one `.js` per view (produced by `npm run package`) |
| **Visual Studio host list** | `visualstudio-extension/src/AIEngineeringFluency/AIEngineeringFluency.csproj` | `_WebviewBundle Include="…\dist\webview\<name>.js"` items (`CopyWebviewBundles` target) |
| **JetBrains host list** | `jetbrains-plugin/build.gradle.kts` | `prepareBundledAssets` → `from(".../dist/webview") { include("<name>.js", …) }` |

At the time of writing VS Code builds **10** views and both hosts ship the same
**6**: `chart, details, diagnostics, environmental, maturity, usage`. The four
VS Code-only views are `dashboard`, `efficiency`, `fluency-level-viewer`, and
`logviewer` — intentionally not shipped by the hosts.

### Why nothing is committed for either host

Neither host commits webview bundle content to git. Both copy the compiled
bundles fresh from `vscode-extension/dist/webview` at their own build time:

- **Visual Studio** does it via the `CopyWebviewBundles` MSBuild target in
  `AIEngineeringFluency.csproj` (`BeforeTargets="Build"`), and the CI/local build
  scripts (`visualstudio-build.yml`, `visualstudio-publish.yml`, `release.yml`,
  `build.ps1`) additionally do a wholesale directory copy before MSBuild runs.
- **JetBrains** does it via `prepareBundledAssets` in `build.gradle.kts`.

This used to differ — Visual Studio committed its copies to the repo as a
"possibly stale" fallback, which drifted out of sync in practice (see
`docs/adr/VS-WEBVIEW-BUNDLE-SOURCING.md`). That fallback has been removed:
both hosts now work exactly like JetBrains always did, so there is nothing left
for this skill to refresh or check for staleness — only the two hosts'
**include lists** (which named views each ships) can still drift from the
canonical VS Code set, and that's all this script tracks.

## What the script reports

`sync-host-views.js` classifies, per host, every canonical view as:

1. **tracked** — the host's build config lists this view.
2. **NEW** — VS Code builds it but the host does not list it. Requires a human
   decision; the script exits `3`.
3. **ORPHAN** — the host lists a view VS Code no longer builds. Mechanical drift;
   the script exits `1`.

## Usage

```bash
# Detect drift and new screens (read-only). Run from the repo root.
node .github/skills/sync-host-views/sync-host-views.js

# Machine-readable output (CI / further processing).
node .github/skills/sync-host-views/sync-host-views.js --json

# Help.
node .github/skills/sync-host-views/sync-host-views.js --help
```

Build the bundles first if `dist/webview` is empty (only affects the informational
`dist/webview built` line in the report — list-drift detection works either way):

```bash
cd vscode-extension && npm run package
```

### Exit codes

| Code | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| `0` | Hosts are in sync — no drift |
| `1` | Mechanical drift the agent can fix (an ORPHAN entry) |
| `2` | Configuration error (a source file was not found / a block moved) |
| `3` | **NEW views detected — stop and ask the user** (takes precedence over `1`) |

## Workflow for the agent

1. **Run the detector.**
   `node .github/skills/sync-host-views/sync-host-views.js`
2. **If exit 3 (NEW views):** do **NOT** add them automatically. Ask the user, one
   view at a time, whether each new VS Code screen should be added to Visual Studio
   and/or JetBrains. Example question: *"VS Code added a `logviewer` screen that
   neither host ships. Add it to Visual Studio, JetBrains, both, or skip?"*
   Only after the user opts in:
   - **Visual Studio:** add `<_WebviewBundle Include="..\..\..\vscode-extension\dist\webview\<name>.js" />`
     to the `CopyWebviewBundles` target **and** a matching `<VSIXSourceItem>` entry
     to the `AddWebviewBundlesToVsix` target in `AIEngineeringFluency.csproj`, and
     wire navigation in `ToolWindow/TokenTrackerControl.xaml.cs`
     (`NavigateToViewAsync` switch) plus any toolbar/menu entry. Check
     `WebBridge/ThemedHtmlBuilder.cs` for view-specific hide rules.
   - **JetBrains:** add `"<name>.js"` to the `include(...)` list in the
     `prepareBundledAssets` task in `build.gradle.kts`, and wire navigation in the
     plugin's tool-window/host code.
3. **If exit 1 due to an ORPHAN:** a host lists a view VS Code removed. Confirm the
   removal was intended, then drop the entry from the host list (the `_WebviewBundle`
   item and its `VSIXSourceItem` for Visual Studio, or the `include(...)` entry for
   JetBrains) — surface this to the user since it removes a screen.
4. **Re-run the detector** until it is clean (or only the intentional NEW views
   the user chose to skip remain).

## Sub-screens / tabs (out of automatic scope)

Some bundles contain multiple sub-screens or tabs (e.g. the chart view's
*by model* / *by editor* / *by repository* toggles, or the tables on the details
page). Those live **inside** a single bundle and stay current automatically
because the bundle is rebuilt fresh on every host build — there is no separate
include entry to add. If a host needs to hide a specific sub-screen it is done
with a CSS rule in `ThemedHtmlBuilder.cs` (Visual Studio) or the equivalent
JetBrains host HTML.
