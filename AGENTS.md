# AI Engineering Fluency — Repository Instructions

(Previously known as the "GitHub Copilot Token Tracker")

This document provides top-level guidance for AI agents contributing to this repository. Detailed, folder-specific instructions live in `.github/instructions/` and are applied automatically by Copilot when you work inside those folders.

## Sub-project Instructions

| Folder | Instructions file |
|---|---|
| `vscode-extension/` | `.github/instructions/vscode-extension.instructions.md` |
| `cli/` | `.github/instructions/cli.instructions.md` |
| `visualstudio-extension/` | `.github/instructions/visualstudio-extension.instructions.md` |
| `jetbrains-plugin/` | `.github/instructions/jetbrains-plugin.instructions.md` |
| `sharing-server/` | [sharing-server/AGENTS.md](sharing-server/AGENTS.md), `.github/instructions/sharing-server.instructions.md` |
| `.github/workflows/` | `.github/instructions/workflows.instructions.md` |

All sharing-server coding, testing, documentation and downstream customization
must follow the [server data separation contract](sharing-server/AGENTS.md).

## Building Everything

Use the root orchestrator from the repo root:

```powershell
./build.ps1                          # build all projects
./build.ps1 -Project vscode          # build VS Code extension only
./build.ps1 -Project cli             # build CLI only
./build.ps1 -Project vscode -Target test   # run tests
```

Individual project builds:
```bash
cd vscode-extension && npm run compile   # VS Code extension
cd cli && npm run build                   # CLI
```

## Documentation

The `docs/` folder contains all project documentation. Start with the index:

📖 **[docs/README.md](docs/README.md)** — Full categorized index of all documentation

Key categories:
- **Core Reference** — fluency scoring rules, data schemas, trackable metrics
- **Component Docs** — per-component guides (`cli/`, `vscode-extension/`, `visual-studio/`, `sharing-server/`, `specs/`)
- **Log File Schemas** — session log formats for all supported editors (`docs/logFilesSchema/`)
- **Feature Docs** — per-feature documentation (`docs/features/`)
- **ADRs** — implementation notes and architectural decisions (`docs/adr/`)

## Development Guidelines

- **Minimal Changes**: Only modify files directly needed for the task. Avoid touching unrelated files.
- **Focused Modifications**: Make surgical, precise changes without affecting other functionality.
- **Preserve Existing Structure**: Don't refactor or reorganize unless essential for the task.

## Never Launch a Real Editor/IDE Instance

AI agents (Claude Code, GitHub Copilot, etc.) must never launch a real, visible instance of an IDE as part of testing or verifying a change — e.g. `code .` / `code <file>`, pressing `F5` to start the VS Code Extension Development Host, `./gradlew runIde` (JetBrains sandbox IDE), or opening Visual Studio/`devenv`. These pop open real windows on the developer's machine, which is disruptive and unexpected when it happens mid-session, especially in unattended or scheduled agent runs.

These steps are documented in places like `.github/instructions/vscode-extension.instructions.md` and `.github/instructions/jetbrains-plugin.instructions.md` **for human developers only**, who can watch the window, click through the UI, and close it when done. An agent has no way to "close" a window it opens and no way to observe it, so these steps are meaningless for automated verification and only cause disruptive side effects.

Instead, verify changes using non-interactive tooling: compile/build scripts (`npm run compile`, `./gradlew build`, `dotnet build`), automated unit test suites (`npm run test:node`, `./gradlew test`, `dotnet test`), and linters/type-checkers. If you are writing or editing a skill, prompt, or instructions file, do not add steps that tell an agent to launch a GUI editor/IDE — mark such steps explicitly as manual/human-only, or omit them entirely from agent-facing docs.

This also governs `.github/github-app.yml`. Its `code .` script has **no `triggers` entry**, on purpose — that makes it an on-demand action a human clicks in the GitHub App's session UI, not something that fires automatically. **Never attach `triggers: [session.create]` (or any other trigger) to a script that launches an editor/IDE.** `automation.auto_issue_session: true` means sessions can be created unattended (e.g. an issue auto-assigned to Copilot) with nobody there to click anything — a triggered `code .` would pop open a real VS Code window during those unattended sessions too, which is the exact bug this section exists to prevent. Non-GUI setup steps (installing dependencies, compiling) are fine to keep on `session.create` since they have no visible side effect.

## CLI Must Reuse Shared Functions

The CLI (`cli/`) is a thin consumer of the shared TypeScript modules in the repo-root `src/` folder (the same modules the VS Code extension uses). **Never reimplement session parsing or cost attribution logic in the CLI — always call the shared functions from `src/`.**

### The canonical split (mirrors `getSessionFileDataCached` in `extension.ts`)

| What you need | Function to call | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Token counts (total, actual, thinking) | `estimateTokensFromJsonlSession()` | `tokenEstimation.ts` |
| Per-model cost attribution (model usage) | `getModelUsageFromSession()` | `usageAnalysis.ts` |
| Debug-log token override | `extractAllTokensFromDebugLog()` | `tokenEstimation.ts` |

**Critical rule**: `estimateTokensFromJsonlSession().modelUsage` must **not** be used as the primary source for model attribution. It returns `{}` for delta-format sessions (VS Code Chat JSONL), causing $0 cost for those sessions. Always call `getModelUsageFromSession()` separately for model attribution — it handles all formats through a single code path.

```typescript
// Correct — matches VS Code's getSessionFileDataCached pattern:
const result = estimateTokensFromJsonlSession(content);         // token counts only
tokens = result.actualTokens > 0 ? result.actualTokens : result.tokens;
fileModelUsage = await getModelUsageFromSession(deps, filePath, content); // attribution

// Wrong — diverges from VS Code, breaks delta-format sessions:
fileModelUsage = result.modelUsage; // empty {} for VS Code Chat sessions
```

If you find yourself adding a fallback like "if modelUsage is empty, call X" in the CLI, that is a sign the primary attribution source is wrong — fix the source instead.

## Coding Agent Data Sources

When running as the GitHub Copilot Coding Agent (bootstrapped via `.github/workflows/copilot-setup-steps.yml`), additional data files may be available in the workspace root. These are downloaded from Azure Storage during the agent's setup phase and are **not** present in local development.

- **`./session-logs/`**: Raw Copilot Chat session log files (last 7 days) from Azure Blob Storage.
- **`./usage-data/usage-agg-daily.json`**: Aggregated daily token usage data (last 30 days) from Azure Table Storage.

These files are only available when the repository's `copilot` GitHub environment has `COPILOT_STORAGE_ACCOUNT` configured. See the `session-log-data` skill in `.github/skills/session-log-data/SKILL.md` for data schemas, analysis examples, and cost estimation.

To check if data is available:
```bash
[ -d ./session-logs ] && echo "Session logs available"
[ -f ./usage-data/usage-agg-daily.json ] && echo "Aggregated data available"
```

### Code knowledge graph (graphify)

`copilot-setup-steps.yml` also builds a graphify knowledge graph of the repository's
code before the agent starts, at **`.graphify-agent/graph.json`** (order of
10k nodes; the exact size tracks the repo, so don't read a precise figure into
it). It needs no secrets — it is local AST parsing (`--code-only`).
The build runs early — before the Azure session-log and usage-data hydration —
so that graphify's dependency tree is installed and executed while there is no
sensitive data on disk for a compromised wheel to read. The pinned Playwright
install and Chromium download that the webview harnesses need sit in the same
early slot for the same reason. That covers graphify and Playwright only: the
azure-storage-loader's own npm dependencies and
`scripts/fetch-agent-sessions.js` still run *after* those files exist, so this
is one contained path rather than a supply-chain boundary for the whole job.
The build is deliberately non-blocking (every step is `continue-on-error`),
which is what lets it run first without a PyPI outage costing the hydration
that follows. Treat the graph as normally available rather than guaranteed, and
check for it before relying on it.

Query it instead of fanning `grep`/read across the tree when the question is
structural — what calls a symbol, what a change reaches, how two areas connect:

```bash
export GRAPHIFY_OUT=.graphify-agent          # or pass --graph .graphify-agent/graph.json

graphify query "how does the CLI attribute per-model cost"   # BFS context for a question
graphify explain "getModelUsageFromSession"                  # one node and its neighbors
graphify affected "src/tokenEstimation.ts"                   # reverse traversal: blast radius
graphify path "extension.ts" "modelPricing.json"             # shortest path between two nodes
```

Notes:
- The graph covers **code only**. Docs, PDFs and images are skipped — semantic
  extraction needs an LLM backend and an API key, which this setup deliberately
  does not use. Read docs directly.
- It is a snapshot from setup time. After large edits, refresh by re-running the
  build: `GRAPHIFY_OUT=.graphify-agent graphify extract . --code-only --no-viz`
  (also LLM-free). Do **not** use `graphify update .` for this: it honours
  `GRAPHIFY_OUT` for the graph itself but still rewrites the committed
  `graphify-out/cache/stat-index.json`, leaving a tracked modification behind.
- Never build into the default `graphify-out/` — that directory's `manifest.json`
  and `cache/` are committed, and a newer graphify prunes them as a stale version.
- If `.graphify-agent/graph.json` is missing the build failed; fall back to
  ordinary file search.

## Agent Changes to CI and Agent Configuration Need a Human

`.github/workflows/guard-agent-config.yml` fails a pull request that both
(a) touches `.github/**`, `.claude/**`, `.devcontainer/**`, `AGENTS.md` or
`CLAUDE.md`, and (b) looks agent-authored — an agent branch prefix
(`claude/`, `copilot/`, `agent-review/`), a bot PR author other than
dependabot or github-actions, or an AI `Co-authored-by:` trailer on any
commit. That trailer match is not limited to Claude and Copilot — it also
covers GPT, Codex, Gemini, Mistral, Vibe, Devin, Cursor and Aider, so do not
read the two examples as the whole list.

These are the files that decide what automation is allowed to do, so an agent
must not be able to change them unattended. If your PR trips this check, that
is the check working: say what you changed and why, and ask the maintainer to
review those paths and add the `agent-config-approved` label. Do not try to
route around it by renaming the branch or dropping the co-author trailer.

## Keep Claude Code's Mirrored Agents & Skills in Sync

This repo also ships Claude Code equivalents of the Copilot customizations below, kept as separate files because the two tools use different formats/locations:

- `.github/agents/*.agent.md` (Copilot custom agents) ↔ `.claude/agents/*.md` (Claude subagents) — same name, same body content, but frontmatter `tools:` uses Claude's tool names (`Read`, `Grep`, `Glob`, `Bash`, `Edit`, `Write`, `Agent`) instead of Copilot's internal tool IDs (`search/codebase`, `execute/runInTerminal`, etc.). Bodies **should** match, but **may** intentionally diverge where the two platforms' mechanics genuinely differ — e.g. CI-driven vs. local Bash invocation, cross-vendor model names vs. Claude Code's own (`opus`/`sonnet`/`haiku`), or the `task` tool vs. the `Agent` tool. Keep any such divergence minimal and deliberate: it should read as a platform adaptation of the same instruction, not a different instruction.
- `.github/skills/*/SKILL.md` (Copilot Agent Skills) ↔ `.claude/skills/*/SKILL.md` (Claude Skills) — **only** the `SKILL.md` is duplicated (same content, same format on both tools). The scripts, README, and other supporting files live **only** under `.github/skills/<name>/` — do not copy them. The `.claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` file's instructions reference those scripts by their real `.github/skills/<name>/...` path, so there is a single source of truth for the code and no duplication.

**If you add, remove, or edit a file under `.github/agents/`, make the matching change under `.claude/agents/` in the same PR** (and vice versa). **If you edit a skill's `SKILL.md` under `.github/skills/`, copy the same edit into `.claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`** — but if you only change a script/README/data file (not `SKILL.md` itself) under `.github/skills/`, no Claude-side change is needed, since Claude's copy just points at that same file. Claude Code does not read `.github/agents/` or `.github/skills/` on its own — without this manual mirroring the Claude-side copy silently goes stale.

## Keep This File's Structure Diagram and Title in Sync

This file's "Repository Structure" diagram and H1 title are the brief every agent
reads to learn what this repo *is*. They go stale the same way the agents/skills
mirror above does, and the failure mode is worse: agents get briefed on a repo
that no longer exists.

**Adding or removing a top-level directory, or renaming the product, requires
updating this file's structure diagram and title in the same PR.** Concretely:

- A new or removed directory under the repo root → add or remove its line (with
  a short one-line description) in the diagram above.
- A product rename → update the H1 and any other name references here, the way
  `README.md`'s title and "Previously known as" line do.

## DevContainer Terminal Behavior

This repository uses a devcontainer (`.devcontainer/devcontainer.json`). When working inside the devcontainer, **terminal output capture is unreliable** — commands execute successfully but the `run_in_terminal` tool often returns empty or truncated output. This is a known limitation of the remote filesystem layer.

### What NOT to do

Do not enter retry loops trying to capture terminal output. These patterns waste turns and never converge:
- Running commands repeatedly hoping output will appear
- Redirecting output to `/tmp/` files and using `read_file` to read them (the remote FS often fails on newly-written temp files)
- Spawning background terminals with `sleep && tail` to poll for results
- Delegating to subagents to "run tests in a clean way"

### What to do instead

1. **Use `npm` scripts for standard operations** (from inside `vscode-extension/`):
   - `npm run compile` — build the extension bundles
   - `npm run validate` — type-check + lint + build
   - `npm run compile-tests` — compile test files to `out/`
   - `npm run test:node` — compile + run unit tests
   - `npm run test:coverage` — compile + run tests with coverage thresholds

2. **Use `get_errors` to validate compilation.** After edits, call `get_errors` on the changed files instead of running `tsc` in the terminal.

3. **Run tests in small batches.** Instead of running all test files in one command, run one file at a time:
   ```bash
   cd vscode-extension
   node --require ./out/vscode-extension/test/unit/vscode-shim-register.js --test out/vscode-extension/test/unit/sessionParser.test.js
   ```

4. **Accept a single run.** If a test command runs without returning output, do **not** re-run it.

5. **Write output to the workspace (not `/tmp/`).** If you must capture output to a file, write it inside the workspace where `read_file` can reliably access it.

## Webview changes must be validated by clicking, not by reading

The `postMessage` wire between a webview panel and the extension host is untyped
by construction, and a `<button>` nobody attached a listener to is
indistinguishable from a working one in the source. Two checks close that gap —
run both after any change under `vscode-extension/src/webview/**` or to a panel's
message handling in `extension.ts`:

```bash
cd vscode-extension
npm run check:contract      # every posted message has a handler on the other side
npm run check:interaction   # clicks every control in every panel, headlessly
```

`check:contract` also runs in CI and as a unit test, so a regression fails the
normal suite. `check:interaction` renders the real bundles headlessly via the
`visual-view-diff` harness — it never opens an editor window, so it is safe for
agents to run (see "Never Launch a Real Editor/IDE Instance" above).

### UI changes come with before/after screenshots

A reviewer cannot judge a UI change from a diff of template strings. For any
change that alters what a panel *looks like*, also run the visual diff and look
at the result before opening the PR:

```bash
cd vscode-extension
npm run visual:diff        # renders merge base vs working tree
```

The output lands at the **repository root**, in `visual-output/` (so
`../visual-output/` from `vscode-extension/`). Read
`visual-output/diff/report.md` there and the diff PNGs. The views you changed
should show as changed and nothing else should — an unexpected "changed" row is
a regression to fix before pushing, and an expected change showing as
"unchanged" means the harness is not looking at what you built (see the next
paragraph). Then, in the PR body, name the views and tabs you expect to change.

CI posts the screenshots for you: the `ui-checks` job runs the same diff and
attaches the before/after/diff images as one comment on the PR, replaced on
every push (`gh pr comment --attach`, via
`.github/workflows/scripts/visual-diff-comment.js`). Do not commit PNGs to the
repo and do not try to upload images by hand; make the CI comment say what the
PR body promised. Uploading needs a user token, so the workflow uses the
`GH_PAT` secret and falls back to an image-free comment without it.

**Adding a new webview panel means adding it to
`.github/skills/visual-view-diff/views.config.json`**, with a fixture capturing
its `__INITIAL_*__` payload. That one registry feeds the visual diff, the CI
screenshots and the interaction crawl — a view missing from it is silently
unvalidated by all three. **Adding a tab or mode to an existing panel means
adding a `state` for it** in the same file — the harness screenshots a view in
its initial render plus its declared states only, so a new section on a tab
with no state diffs as "unchanged" and ships without a screenshot.

The full picture of what each check catches, and the one-command release
preflight, is in [docs/VALIDATION.md](docs/VALIDATION.md).

## Localization changes require test coverage

When adding or changing runtime localization keys (entries in `vscode-extension/package.nls.json` / `package.nls.zh-cn.json` consumed via the `l10n.t()` helper in `vscode-extension/src/l10n.ts`), add unit tests in `vscode-extension/test/unit/l10n.test.ts` asserting the new keys resolve to their expected English text (and zh-CN translation where one exists). PR review flags localization changes that ship without this coverage.

## File-size ceiling (`max-lines`)

`vscode-extension/eslint.config.mjs` enforces `"max-lines": ["warn", { max: 6000, ... }]` alongside the existing complexity rules. The per-function rules (`max-lines-per-function`, `complexity`, `sonarjs/cognitive-complexity`) were all satisfied while `vscode-extension/src/extension.ts` grew to 12,332 lines and 553 methods — proof that small functions alone don't stop a file from becoming unmanageable. New code should not push any linted file past 6000 lines; if you're about to, split it instead. `extension.ts` is today's sole (known) outlier, and stays that way on purpose until it's decomposed — see `docs/adr/EXTENSION-TS-DECOMPOSITION.md` for the extraction plan. Ratchet the 6000 number down as files shrink; don't raise it to accommodate growth.

## Pre-PR self-review checklist

PR #2107 took ~12 rounds of Copilot review-agent feedback over ~22 hours to land, with every fix pushed as its own commit (never amended, never force-pushed). The many-rounds loop wasn't caused by amending or force-pushing — it never did that. It happened because each fix commit closed only the single race condition or edge case the reviewer had named (e.g. one `await` point where a peer clear/write could interleave), instead of enumerating and closing the whole class of similar cases at once. The reviewer kept finding the next adjacent gap in the same state machine, round after round.

Before pushing a fix for review feedback, agents must:

- **Close the whole class, not just the cited instance.** When a review comment flags one case of a bug (one race condition, one edge case, one unguarded call site), explicitly enumerate the full set of cases/call-sites/interleavings/state transitions that issue belongs to (e.g. every `await` point in the same state machine where a concurrent clear/write/reset could interleave), and fix all of them in that same pass — not just the one instance the reviewer pointed at.
- **Batch a full round into one push.** Before pushing, collect and address every currently-open review comment together, then push once for that round. Don't push a commit per individual fix as each comment trickles in — that's what turns a handful of review rounds into a dozen.
