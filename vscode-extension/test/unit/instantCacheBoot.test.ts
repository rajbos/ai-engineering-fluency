/**
 * Regression guard for the boot-time changes made for issue #2018 fix #2
 * (persist the discovery list, render from it immediately):
 *
 *   1. `renderInstantStatsFromCache()` paints the status bar from the on-disk
 *      cache alone (no discovery, no fs.stat, no parsing) the moment
 *      `scheduleInitialUpdate()` runs, so a cold boot shows real numbers
 *      before the full discover→parse pass even starts.
 *   2. `seedPreloadQueueFromCache()` seeds the preload worker queue with the
 *      cache's known file paths before adapter discovery starts, so the
 *      worker pool begins stat+cache-validating files from tick zero instead
 *      of waiting on the slowest adapter's directory walk.
 *
 * Also covers the fixes made in response to PR #2080's Copilot review:
 *   3. The instant paint must not block on the OpenCode DB probe chained onto
 *      the cache-file load (queueMissingOpenCodeDbSessionsFromCache() does its
 *      own SQLite I/O), and must not run at all in sample-data mode (it would
 *      otherwise mix real user sessions into a screenshot/regression fixture).
 *   4. Cache-to-discovery deduplication must use the same path normalization
 *      SessionDiscovery uses across adapters, or a differently-cased/separated
 *      cached key can coexist with a freshly discovered one and double-count
 *      the same file.
 *   5. `_preloadSessionFiles()` must not discard already-seeded `preloaded`
 *      results just because this run's adapter discovery came back empty.
 *   6. The cache snapshot itself (not just cache-vs-discovery) can contain
 *      multiple raw-path spellings of the same physical file, which both the
 *      instant paint and the cache-seeded queue must deduplicate against.
 *   7. `_runRefreshCore()`'s one-time full-year chart backfill must not run
 *      against an empty `sessionFiles` when real cache-seeded `preloaded`
 *      data exists — calculateDailyStats(365, []) sets `lastFullDailyStats`
 *      to `[]`, and since an empty array is truthy, showChart() would treat
 *      that as complete data and get stuck showing an empty chart.
 *
 * This isn't a runtime test (instantiating `CopilotTokenTracker` requires a
 * full VS Code host and file-system session discovery — see
 * analysisUpdateStatsPayload.test.ts for the same constraint), so instead it
 * asserts structural invariants directly on the source.
