# Change Log

All notable changes to the VS Code extension will be documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]

### Features
- New "⚡ HydraFusion Routing" section in the Session Log Viewer for Copilot CLI sessions that ran on the `hydrafusion` synthetic model. HydraFusion spends several real models on one prompt — drafting, judging, repairing — then hands back a single answer and a single credit figure; this section reconstructs the legs behind it from the routing decisions the CLI records for its own resume and rewind. It shows how often the router went compound rather than single-model, how often a judge rejected the first answer, what share of credits went on review rather than on the answer you received, which models served which legs and which of them actually supplied answers, where the credits went per phase kind, and a per-turn breakdown with the planned route (including conditional legs that never ran), each leg's verdict, duration and cost, and a marker on the leg whose output you actually read. See [docs/logFilesSchema/hydrafusion-routing-events.md](../docs/logFilesSchema/hydrafusion-routing-events.md)
- The Usage Analysis "Context Window" section now counts *sessions* that ran out of context, not just compaction events: two new rows per period show how many sessions were automatically compacted (out of those with context data) and how many Copilot CLI sessions filled at least 80% of their window without compacting, plus the fullest session's fill percentage. Two new insights go with it — a tip when sessions repeatedly approach the limit, and a celebration when none of them do — and the existing auto-compaction insight now reports the per-session share as well
- The "Some sessions nearly ran out of context window" insight is now actionable: a "Show these N sessions" button opens the Usage Analysis "Recent Sessions" tab over the last 30 days, filtered to exactly the sessions it counted. The same drill-down is available directly in that tab — a new "Context" column shows how full each session's window got (flagged with ⚠️ at 80% or more), and a "🧠 Near context limit" filter pill narrows the list to those sessions. Context fill is now filled in for every lookback period, not only Today
- Worktree cleanup now explains *why* each worktree could not be removed and lets you act on it: every skipped/failed row shows when the folder was last touched, the last commit's age, whether the branch still has a remote (and whether that remote branch was deleted), the ahead/behind push status, and the number of modified/untracked files — plus "💻 Open in VS Code", "📂 Reveal folder" and "🗑️ Delete anyway…" buttons on the row itself
- New "What's New" view (command palette: *AI Engineering Fluency: What's New*) listing the last 5 releases in plain English, plus a one-at-a-time notification that points out a new view/tab/section after an update — at most one a day, at most 3 per release, and never one you already opened yourself. Turn the notifications off with `aiEngineeringFluency.whatsNew.notificationsEnabled`; see [docs/features/WHATS-NEW.md](../docs/features/WHATS-NEW.md)
- New "Research > TTFT" tab in the Diagnostic Report: time-to-first-token averages by day/week/month with a trendline per model, read from VS Code Copilot Chat's own debug log (`attrs.ttft`) — no setup required, see [docs/features/TTFT-TRENDS.md](../docs/features/TTFT-TRENDS.md)
- New "Skill Suggestions" section in the Usage Analysis Tools & Integrations tab: clusters the first prompt of each session to find tasks you keep prompting for manually (candidates for a reusable skill or prompt file), plus a new insight when a task repeats across 3+ sessions
- New "Corrections" tab in the Usage Analysis view: surfaces moments where the agent corrected itself after an error (failed tool calls, immediate edit retries, verbal self-corrections) or you had to correct the agent, grouped per repository over its 25 most recent sessions with detected moments
- New insights that fire when user corrections or tool-error/edit-retry volume in the last 30 days is high, pointing to the Corrections tab
- New "🤖 Ask Copilot to fix this" button per repository in the Corrections tab (plus a matching action on the "you had to correct the agent repeatedly" insight): builds a prompt from that repo's most notable correction examples and sends it to Copilot Chat, asking for concrete workspace-setup improvements (instructions files, custom instructions, prompt files) grounded in what actually went wrong — with a "Copy prompt" fallback for pasting into a different workspace's chat
- Group models from user-configured custom endpoints (BYOK) under their own provider group (e.g. `Mistral (Custom)`) in the Details "Cost by Provider" panel and the provider charts, instead of lumping them into "GitHub Copilot"/"Other"
- Show only the model part of a three-part custom-endpoint model ID (`customendpoint/Mistral/mistral-medium-latest` → `mistral-medium-latest`), and estimate its cost from that model's pricing entry
- Efficiency view, Cost Attribution tab: hovering a factor bar now shows a self-contained tooltip with the previous and current value, their unit and the signed estimated cost effect at full precision (e.g. `Session count: 64 → 73 sessions` / `Estimated cost effect: +$7.3500`), instead of raw ungrouped numbers. Every number on the tab — costs, session counts, blended rates — now formats through the shared locale-aware helpers, so groupings, decimal separators and the USD symbol follow your locale, and a non-zero sub-cent effect renders as `-$0.0037` rather than a misleading `-$0.00`
- The status bar hover popup is easier to read: the Today / Current Month / Last 30 Days columns now have a proper gutter between them (the header row included), "💰 Costs by Provider — Current Month" doubles as its table's header instead of sitting above an empty one, provider costs are right-aligned into a single column, and the "🎯 Copilot Budget" gauge no longer wraps — its tracked amount, untracked (other devices/cloud) amount and remaining budget are three short lines beneath it rather than being crammed onto the gauge row and one run-on sub-row

### Performance
- Opening the Efficiency view no longer jumps to 96% and then sits there. The whole wait used to happen inside a step the progress bar drew as "the last 4%", because the view reported a single "computing" step and then went quiet. The bar now tracks the full-year daily-stats pass file by file — the only one of the view's three passes that parses anything cold, since the other two read strict subsets of the same window straight out of the session cache it fills
- Efficiency builds are serialized, so opening the view and refreshing it can no longer interleave their writes to the shared stat caches and leave the older result behind
- The Efficiency loading screen now reports real progress: per-file counts and editor pills while session logs are parsed, then named sub-steps ("Aggregating daily activity", "Analysing usage patterns", "Reading session signals", "Building efficiency trends") as the aggregation runs. Refreshing the view shows the same progress instead of leaving the old numbers frozen on screen
- Every loading screen's progress bar now moves forward across the step from parsing into computing. The bar is one value with two bands — parsing fills the first 85%, the compute phase the rest — where previously parsing ran to 100% and the compute step set it back to a fixed 96%. Within parsing the bar still tracks the reported percentage in both directions, because session discovery streams in batches and the total it is measured against grows as they arrive; pinning it there would freeze the bar at an early batch's high-water mark instead. This applies to the Details panel and the desktop tray app as well, whose parsing progress now fills 0–85% rather than 0–100% before their compute step takes it to 96%
- The Details/Environmental loading screen no longer parks at a fixed 96% for the whole compute phase on first launch: the main refresh now reports named sub-steps ("Calculating usage statistics", "Analysing usage patterns", "Scoring AI fluency") as it works through them, the same pattern the Efficiency view already used. The Environmental Impact panel, which previously showed no progress at all while waiting on the very same refresh, now receives these updates too
- A scan with many slow-to-parse session files no longer piles up hundreds of them running concurrently in the background. A parse that exceeds the per-file timeout is deferred to keep going without blocking the rest of the scan, but nothing previously capped how many could be in flight at once — on a large cache this meant hundreds of CPU-bound parses competing for the same single-threaded event loop that also delivers progress updates to the loading screen, which is very likely why that screen could look frozen even though work was still happening. The number of concurrently deferred parses is now capped, with new work pausing briefly until a slot frees up
- The cache checkpoint that runs periodically during a long scan no longer saves to disk when nothing has actually changed. It used to fire on a time interval alone, so a scan that was 100% cache hits still triggered a full read-merge-write of the shared snapshot file every ~20 seconds for no effect; it also undercounted real changes (a re-parsed, changed file didn't count toward the threshold) and could run from a follower window, writing that window's deliberately partial cache over the leader's in-progress snapshot. All three are fixed: the checkpoint now only runs the leader, and only when there is something dirty (a new, changed, or deleted entry) to save

### Bug Fixes
- The "🎯 Copilot Budget" tooltip row now states spend and remaining budget against the *combined* tracked + untracked total, matching the percentage shown on its bar — previously the headline "$X / $Y" figure only counted this device's locally-tracked usage, so a reader had to notice the separate "untracked (other devices/cloud)" sub-row and subtract it themselves to find out how much budget was actually left. Remaining budget is listed on its own line under the gauge rather than appended to it
- Clearing the cache no longer leaves any view serving numbers from before the clear. A calculation already running when you cleared would finish afterwards and write its result — computed from the cache you had just emptied — back into the shared statistics, and the next open would reuse it. Each of those cached statistics now records the state it was computed from, and anything produced before a clear is recalculated rather than reused. A refresh that was already in flight no longer gets to *display* its pre-clear result one last time either: it discards its results instead of pushing them to the status bar and the Details, Chart, Usage Analysis, Maturity and Environmental views — insight cards and their notifications included — and the clear waits for it and then runs a real refresh of its own rather than reusing the discarded one. Clearing also now waits for a pre-existing refresh's still-running foreground session-file parses, and for any it has already deferred to the background, before it clears — previously such a parse finishing after the clear (whether it was still on its ordinary pass over a file or had already timed out into the background) could silently repopulate the cache with the exact pre-clear data the clear was meant to remove. (Two gaps remain, tracked separately: clearing does not itself reset the insight badge, which keeps its last counts until the next evaluation replaces them; and the wait for a pre-clear refresh's parses has no deadline of its own — a single session file whose read never settles (e.g. an unresponsive network mount) would leave Clear Cache blocked rather than resurrecting stale data, the same accepted trade-off already made for the deferred-parse reserve pool elsewhere in this cache rework. The gap noted here previously — the on-disk snapshot having no tombstone, so such an in-flight save could put its entries back — is fixed: a cleared cache deletes tombstones too and its on-disk delete is serialized against any write already in flight, in this window or another)
- A cleared cache can no longer be silently undone by another open VS Code window. Previously, clearing the cache only reset *this* window's own memory and deleted its on-disk snapshot — a second window with its own, untouched copy of the pre-clear data could still republish it later (its next checkpoint or refresh save, whenever that happened to run — not just one already in flight at the moment of the clear), or simply keep showing it on screen from its own memory, with nothing telling that window a clear had happened anywhere. A small durable marker file now records every clear; every window checks it before publishing a save (so a save built from pre-clear data is skipped instead of landing on disk) and once per refresh cycle (so an already-open window drops its own stale in-memory data instead of continuing to display it), closing both gaps. The marker is advanced under the same lock, and in the same held critical section, that now serializes the on-disk delete against any write in flight — so a writer blocked on that lock is only ever let through once both the delete and the marker bump have landed, and always sees the fresh marker before it can publish. If the marker write itself fails (e.g. a disk error), Clear Cache no longer reports unconditional success: the command now surfaces a warning that other open windows may not see the clear, instead of silently claiming the cross-window fence held when it did not. The same is true if deleting the on-disk snapshot itself fails for a genuine reason (not just "already gone"): since a failed delete is often a transient file lock rather than a real permissions failure, the clear now falls back to replacing the snapshot with an empty one (the same tmp-file-plus-rename publish path already used elsewhere, which only needs to replace the directory entry) before giving up — only when that also fails does the marker stay un-advanced, for the same "don't tell a window a clear happened when the stale snapshot is still fully present" reason. Either failure path also now bookmarks this window's own mtime tracking against the still-present file, so this window's own very next refresh cannot resurrect the same data it just failed to clear either, independent of any peer. A peer's clear is now also visible to more than just the cache manager's own session cache: it also drops the extension's separate per-view statistics and diagnostics view state, and (if open) rebuilds the Efficiency panel and reloads the Diagnostic Report, the same invalidation a local clear already does — previously only a local clear reached that far, so a peer's clear could leave a reopened view, or an already-open Efficiency or Diagnostic Report panel, rendering pre-clear numbers indefinitely. The very first, provisional "instant paint" a window does from its on-disk cache at startup now also re-checks for a peer's clear immediately before reading that cache, closing a narrow gap where one landing in the brief window after the startup cache load finishes but before that first paint runs would otherwise go undetected and flash stale numbers for the few seconds until the real refresh overwrites them. (A gap remains, tracked separately: a session-file parse that was already in flight in a *peer* window before that peer's clear, and only finishes afterward, is not covered by the wait clearCache() now does for its own window's in-flight parses — it can still land its result straight into that peer's in-memory cache after the peer has otherwise correctly detected and dropped the clear, and get published on that peer's next save. Closing this needs each in-flight parse to carry the epoch active when it started and get rejected on a mismatch when it completes, the same shape of fix as the same-window one above, extended across windows — a separate, larger change. A second gap: this fence only protects peers running this same, updated `CacheManager` — a window still on a previous extension version writes the shared snapshot without ever consulting the epoch file, so its post-clear (to it, ordinary) publish can still land pre-clear data that every up-to-date window will accept, having no way to tell it apart from a legitimate one. Closing this needs the snapshot envelope itself to carry the epoch it was written under, and every loader to reject one older than its own baseline — a cache-version-level protocol change, not an extension of the marker-file check, and one that would invalidate every user's on-disk cache on the next update, so it is deliberately deferred rather than folded in here. A third gap: `deleteSharedSnapshot()` can be stuck retrying the shared cache lock for its whole retry budget (up to 10s) against a peer holding it, before it ever unlinks the snapshot or advances the epoch — a same-process fix now rejects a save or load started in exactly that window on *this* window (a `clearInProgress` counter, checked alongside the epoch and generation), but a *different* window has no way to observe it: nothing durable records "a clear is in flight, not just decided" until the epoch marker itself is written at the very end of that window. A peer's load landing anywhere in that up-to-10-second gap can still merge the still-present pre-clear snapshot undetected. Closing this needs a durable, cross-window "clear intent" signal peers can check before the epoch itself is known to have moved — visible earlier in the sequence than the epoch bump this PR already added, and with its own staleness/dead-owner handling akin to the lock file's — a fourth marker file and lifecycle, not an extension of the existing checks. A fourth: the epoch is a plain float64 number, so it cannot be safely incremented once it reaches `Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER` — under real, `Date.now()`-driven usage this needs longer than any deployment will run, but a marker corrupted to exactly that value is a real, if narrow, input. On hitting it, the fix holds the epoch at the ceiling rather than picking a smaller replacement, since falling back to a smaller value would *regress* it below whatever a peer may have already adopted, letting that peer silently treat every later real clear as old — worse than the write simply failing to advance. Properly resolving exhaustion (so a clear that hits this ceiling is still individually detectable) needs a wider representation, such as a `BigInt` or decimal string, everywhere the epoch is read, compared and persisted — a representation change, not an extension of the numeric comparisons this PR's checks already do. A fifth: `clearInProgressCount` is only ever decremented by `deleteSharedSnapshot()`, so `clearAllCachedData()` — a public method — must always be immediately followed by a matching `deleteSharedSnapshot()` call; `clearCache()`, the only production caller, already does this with no `await` in between, so the gap does not occur there today, but nothing in the type system enforces the pairing for any other caller. Calling `clearAllCachedData()` alone (e.g. a future feature wanting only an in-memory reset, or a test) wedges the counter above zero permanently, silently failing every later save and discarding every later load on that instance. Properly closing this needs a single method that owns both halves atomically instead of two independently-callable public methods — a public API change, not just an internal fix, so it is deferred rather than folded in here; a regression test in `cacheManager-snapshot.test.ts` documents the current, accepted shape of this gap. A sixth: `readClearEpoch()` fails open to `0` for both a genuinely missing marker (the normal, expected first-run case, where `0` is correct) and a corrupt/unparseable one (an abnormal case where the real value might be far higher and is simply unknown). Combined with a backward system-clock step on the window doing the bump, this can write a new epoch below a value some peer already legitimately holds — that peer's `persisted <= this.clearEpoch` check then treats this real clear (and any further ones, until the clock catches up) as old. The existing local-epoch floor only protects a window that already observed the higher value itself; a window with no local memory of it (freshly started, or simply new) has nothing to floor against. Properly closing this needs either distinguishing "missing" from "corrupt" and refusing to advance in the latter case (at the cost of leaving the fence permanently disabled until the corruption is manually cleared, since every future clear would hit the same corrupt read) or a redundant, independently-recoverable source of truth for the epoch — both larger trade-offs than this PR's marker-file design, and deliberately not attempted here. This compound precondition (corruption plus a simultaneous backward clock step) is the same class of narrow, accepted residual risk as the two-clears-racing-the-lock gap already noted elsewhere in this entry)
- Every view now declares the language it is actually written in, instead of always claiming English. Screen readers were being told to pronounce translated interface text with English pronunciation rules
- "Last 30 Days" now means the same 30 calendar dates everywhere: the Usage Analysis period totals (tokens, corrections, context pressure, multi-agent trend, and every other "Last 30 Days" statistic) previously started one day earlier than the Recent Sessions tab's `last30` lookback and the chart's rolling 30-day window, so a session active on that extra day could count toward a total without appearing in a same-labelled session list. Both now derive from the same boundary calculation
- Insight notifications now take you to the insight, not just to the tab: the toast's "View" action and the status-bar "💡 N insights" badge scroll the Insights tab to the specific card they named and briefly outline it, instead of leaving you to find it among a dozen look-alike cards. The badge also counts what the Insights tab actually shows: it previously counted from stored state that keeps entries for insights which no longer apply, so it could claim more insights than the tab listed — and miss one whose snooze had just expired
- Fix Cursor session reads filling `%temp%` with multi-GB `cursor-wal-*.db` snapshots when Cursor is running alongside VS Code (#2033): reads Cursor's live `state.vscdb` through a read-only, copy-free connection instead of copying and checkpointing the whole database on every poll; the still-present copy-based fallback now caps the database size it will ever copy, throttles merge attempts per database, and backs off further while a writer looks active. A one-time best-effort sweep on activation reclaims any `cursor-wal-*`/`sqlite-wal-*` temp files stranded by earlier versions
- The worktree cleanup report no longer disappears when the run empties the worktree list — the skipped/failed rows you still have to act on stayed hidden behind the "No worktrees found yet" empty state
- Corrections tab filtering is now readable: the "📈 escalating" badge is a real filter pill (it did nothing when clicked before), active pills are outlined and bold with a "✕" plus a "Clear filter" button, a "Showing X of Y listed correction moments" bar states what the list below is filtered to, each repository header reports how many of its sessions and moments match, and the empty-filter state explains why a counted moment can sit outside the capped detail sample
- Fix the "Efficiency" nav button in the Efficiency view doing nothing when clicked — the view passed no active view to the shared nav bar, so its own button rendered enabled with no click handler instead of being marked as the current page
- Surface a warning when copying a path from the Usage Analysis view fails: the webview reported the failure but nothing on the extension side listened, so a failed copy was completely silent
- Sharing-server sync now reports "Copilot App" and "Claude (VS Code)" as their own editor labels (matching the local Interaction Modes view) instead of lumping them into "Copilot CLI"/"Claude Code" — the team dashboard's "Editors Used" panel previously had no way to show these categories at all, since the synced `editor` field never carried the distinction

### Chores
- New validation tooling: `npm run preflight` runs every check in one pass (see [docs/VALIDATION.md](../docs/VALIDATION.md)), `npm run check:contract` fails the build when a webview message has no handler on the other side, and `npm run check:interaction` clicks every control in every panel headlessly. CI now also renders before/after webview screenshots on pull requests
