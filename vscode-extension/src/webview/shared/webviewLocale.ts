/**
 * The one place a webview bundle applies everything locale-related from its
 * initial payload.
 *
 * Every bundle used to repeat the same four lines — initialize the dictionary,
 * dig `__language__` out of it, set the current language — and only two of the
 * twelve also called `setFormatLocale()`, so the other ten formatted numbers
 * and dates with whatever locale the runtime happened to default to.
 *
 * Two fields, not one, because they answer different questions
 * (docs/adr/LOCALIZATION-ARCHITECTURE.md, S4):
 *
 *   - `language` — *which strings*. Resolved to a locale we actually ship a
 *     bundle for, so English text is never labelled `lang="fr"`.
 *   - `locale` — *how numbers and dates are written*. Comes from the user's
 *     regional settings, which are legitimately independent: a German
 *     developer running an English VS Code wants `1.234,56` and English UI.
