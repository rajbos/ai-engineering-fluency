/**
 * Which group tab each of the Usage Analysis leaf tabs lives under.
 *
 * The view reached nine tabs in one strip, which wrapped onto a second row at ordinary panel
 * widths and offered no way to tell at a glance that "Repository PRs" and "Cloud Agent" are the
 * same kind of thing. This mirrors the two-level strip the Diagnostics view already uses.
 *
 * **Leaf tab ids are unchanged and must stay that way.** They are the `viewTabOpened` telemetry
 * key the host records against, the `switchTab` message payload, and the target of the What's New
 * view's "Take me there" deep links — all of which name a tab from outside this module. (The
 * in-memory `activeTab` uses them too; it is not persisted — `UsageWebviewState` stores only
 * `aboutCollapsed`.) Grouping them is chrome; renaming them would break those three callers.
