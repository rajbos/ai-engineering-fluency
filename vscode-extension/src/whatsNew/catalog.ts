/**
 * Declarative catalog of what shipped in each release, in plain English.
 *
 * This file is the single source of truth for two things:
 *
 *   1. The **What's New** view — it renders the most recent
 *      {@link WHATS_NEW_MAX_RELEASES} entries below as readable prose. It is
 *      deliberately *not* the CHANGELOG: the changelog is written for people
 *      reading a diff ("Fix `Other` row sorting into the top-N list"), this is
 *      written for someone who just wants to know what they can now do.
 *   2. The one-at-a-time "new here" notifications — every entry in `features`
 *      names the exact surface it added, so the announcer can skip anything
 *      the user already found on their own, and the notification's button can
 *      open it.
 *
 * ## Adding a release
 *
 * Prepend a new {@link WhatsNewRelease} (newest first) when you bump the
 * extension version. Only list things a *user* can point at — a new view, a
 * new tab, a new section on an existing tab. Bug fixes and refactors belong in
 * the changelog, not here.
 *
 * Keep `features` short. The announcer only ever announces
 * {@link WHATS_NEW_MAX_ANNOUNCEMENTS_PER_RELEASE} of them per release, so a
 * list of ten is nine items of noise and one item of signal; put the ones that
 * matter first.
 *
 * Feature `id`s are persisted in globalState to remember what a user has
 * already been told. **Never reuse or renumber an id** — a recycled id silently
 * suppresses the announcement for everyone who saw the old feature.
 *
 * Run `node .github/skills/whats-new-catalog/whats-new-catalog.js` after editing:
 * it catches a missing entry for the current version, a surface pointing at a
 * view or tab that no longer exists, and features sitting below the
 * announcement cap. See `.github/skills/whats-new-catalog/SKILL.md`.
