/**
 * Host-side bookkeeping for "take me there" requests (View index, What's New):
 * which request is waiting for which panel, and when it may be delivered.
 *
 * Pure — generic over the panel type, with an injectable clock — so the
 * timing-sensitive handshake can be unit tested without VS Code. The host
 * (`openViewSurface` in extension.ts) drives it:
 *
 *   1. `request()` before calling a view's opener: a panel the opener creates
 *      may report ready before the opener resolves.
 *   2. `opened()` once the opener resolved, with the panel it left behind.
 *      Returns the navigation to post now when the panel was reused (no ready
 *      handshake will follow), else null.
 *   3. `ready()` when a panel's webview reports `surfaceNavReady`. Returns
 *      the navigation to post, or null.
 *   4. `handled()` when the webview reports `surfaceRevealHandled` — the
 *      reveal landed, nothing is left to replay.
 *
 * A request only ever reaches the panel it was meant for: once `opened()`
 * names that panel, a ready from any other panel (say, one the user reopened
 * by hand) drops it. Before that, a newly created panel qualifies, and a ready
 * from the panel that was already open is held for `opened()` to settle. And a request expires after `ttlMs`, so it can never redirect a
 * panel the user later opens on their own.
