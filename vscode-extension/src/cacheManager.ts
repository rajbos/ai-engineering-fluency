	 * against a now-empty cache: the next leader refresh's flushPendingCheckpointBeforeReset()

	 * under one held lock (see its own doc comment) whenever it actually acquired one; when its own
	 * retry budget was spent first, it calls this anyway, unlocked, on the same best-effort
	 * reasoning as the write failure case above — the fence must still advance rather than silently

	 *
	 * Also bumps `cacheClearGeneration`, the same in-memory counter clearAllCachedData() bumps: a

	 *
	 * Also resets the checkpoint dirty-count accounting via resetCheckpointCounters(), the same

	 * with a checkpoint already mid-flight (see that method's own doc comment).
	 *
	 * Public (not just used internally by writeSharedSnapshot()/loadSharedSnapshotIfChanged()/
	 * loadCacheFromStorage()) so a caller that reads `cache` directly outside those methods — e.g. a
	 * provisional/instant paint built straight from the in-memory cache after awaiting an earlier

	 * from its own memory past its next check. The epoch is advanced even when there was no snapshot
	 * file to delete (or it was already gone), since the fence must hold regardless of what was on
	 * disk at the time — but NOT when the delete genuinely fails and the snapshot is still there; see
	 * the unlink failure branch below and this method's "Returns" note.
	 *
	 * Acquires the same cache save lock writeSharedSnapshot() holds while it builds and renames a
	 * snapshot — retrying briefly rather than the usual single-shot acquire, since this specific
	 * caller must not proceed while any writer (this window's own periodic checkpoint or
	 * persistRefreshResult() save, or another window's) could still be mid-write. cacheClearGeneration
	 * (bumped by clearAllCachedData(), checked inside writeSharedSnapshot()) only lives in this
	 * process's memory, so it can abort a same-process write that hasn't reached its rename yet, but
	 * it cannot reach into another window's process at all, and can't undo a same-process write
	 * whose generation check already passed before the bump landed. Serializing on the shared lock
	 * file instead closes both gaps: any writer, in this window or a peer's, holds this exact lock
	 * for the small window between its own read and its rename, so acquiring it first guarantees no
	 * writer's rename can land after this delete. Proceeds anyway once the retry budget is spent
	 * (see acquireCacheLockWithRetry()) rather than blocking "Clear Cache" forever on a peer
	 * holding a stuck lock — that residual gap only matters against a writer that neither finishes
	 * nor gets its stale lock broken within that budget, an accepted trade-off documented there.
	 *
	 * When the lock above was actually acquired, the epoch bump happens inside that SAME held lock,
	 * not after releasing it: a writer blocked on it is only let through once both the delete and
	 * the bump have landed, so it always sees the fresh epoch via checkClearEpoch() before it can
	 * publish anything. Bumping after releasing the lock would reopen a gap of its own — a writer
	 * could acquire the lock in between, find the pre-bump epoch, and publish before the bump ever
	 * catches it. When the retry budget above was spent instead (lock never acquired), the bump
	 * still runs — unlocked, best-effort — because the fence must advance regardless; that call is
	 * not serialized against a concurrent writer the way the held-lock case is. See
	 * `bumpClearEpochLocked()`'s own doc comment for that narrower, already-accepted fallback gap.
	 *
	 * Returns whether this window's clear is now durably visible to peers: the on-disk snapshot was
	 * actually removed, replaced with an empty one, or already gone, AND the epoch marker was
	 * actually persisted. `false` means neither the delete nor its empty-snapshot fallback could land
	 * — a peer must not be told a clear happened at all in that case, so the epoch bump is skipped
