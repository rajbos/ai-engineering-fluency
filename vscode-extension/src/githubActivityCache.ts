/**
 * Shared policy for the two GitHub-activity caches — Repository PRs (`repoPrCache.ts`) and Copilot
 * cloud-agent tasks (`agentTasksCache.ts`).
 *
 * Both caches hold data that GitHub only shows to one authenticated account on one host, so both
 * need the same three things, which live here so the two cannot drift apart:
 *
 * - **Scoping.** A cache file is only ever read back by the same VS Code mode (dev/prod), the same
 *   normalized GitHub host, and the same account. The account contributes a non-reversible hash,
 *   never its login: the file *name* ends up in `globalStorage` next to everything else, and a
 *   readable login there would leak who is signed in. Signing out, switching accounts or pointing
 *   `github-enterprise.uri` at another host therefore lands on a different file rather than
 *   re-serving the previous identity's private data. Access tokens are never part of the scope and
 *   are never written to disk.
 * - **Entity timestamps.** Reuse of a cached projection is gated on the entity's `updated_at`
 *   matching the authoritative listing *exactly*. A missing, non-string or unparseable timestamp is
 *   uncacheable — it can never be matched, so those entities are always recomputed.
 * - **Bounds.** These caches are local-only conveniences, so they are allowed to lose data: record
 *   and byte budgets evict the least recently updated entries, and whole inactive scopes are
 *   dropped before the active one. Eviction must only ever cause a refetch — never a silently
 *   incomplete total — which is why every caller pairs it with the "did the listing complete?"
 *   flags in the two cache modules.
 *
 * Everything here is a pure function except the file helpers at the bottom, so the policy can be
 * unit tested without touching disk (the same split `agentTasksCache.ts` already uses).
