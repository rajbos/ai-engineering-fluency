/**
 * Cross-window cache for the Repository PRs snapshot.
 *
 * Collecting AI PR activity costs a PR-list call (plus a commit-messages call per PR to detect
 * co-authored-by AI) for every discovered repo, so it is deliberately expensive to refresh: the
 * snapshot is written to a JSON file in the extension's global storage (shared by every VS Code
 * window of this edition) and refreshed at most once an hour, by whichever window currently holds
 * the repo-PRs lock. Every other window — and every panel open in between — reads this file
 * instead of calling GitHub.
 *
 * The file I/O lives here; the freshness decisions are pure functions so they can be unit tested
 * without touching disk. This mirrors the split used by `agentTasksCache.ts` for the Cloud Agent tab.
