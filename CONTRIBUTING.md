## Development Environment Setup

You have two options for setting up your development environment:

1. **Using the DevContainer** (Recommended for AI-assisted development)
2. Manual local setup

### Prerequisites

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)
- [Dev Containers extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers) for VS Code

## Using the DevContainer (Recommended)

### Quick Start

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/rajbos/ai-engineering-fluency.git
   cd ai-engineering-fluency
   ```

2. **Open in VS Code:**

   ```bash
   code .
   ```

3. **Reopen in Container:**
   - When prompted, click "Reopen in Container"
   - Or use the Command Palette (`F1`) and select **Dev Containers: Reopen in Container**

4. **Wait for setup:**
   - The container will build and initialize automatically
   - Dependencies will be installed via `pnpm install` (runs automatically)
   - All required VS Code extensions will be pre-installed

5. **Start developing:**
   - Run `pnpm run watch` to start the TypeScript compiler in watch mode
   - Press `F5` to launch the Extension Development Host

### What's Included in the DevContainer?

The devcontainer provides a complete, pre-configured development environment:

- **Base Image:** Node.js 22 on Debian Bookworm
- **Pre-installed Tools:**
  - Git
  - PowerShell (for running build scripts)
  - Node.js and pnpm
- **VS Code Extensions:**
  - ESLint (code linting)
  - Prettier (code formatting)
  - Extension Test Runner
  - TSL Problem Matcher
  - GitHub Copilot & Copilot Chat
- **Optimized Settings:**
  - Format on save enabled
  - ESLint integration
  - TypeScript support

## Why Use a DevContainer for AI-Assisted Development?

The devcontainer is **especially valuable when working with AI coding assistants** like GitHub Copilot or other AI agents. Here's why:

### 🛡️ Isolation and Safety

When you give AI assistants permission to execute commands, install packages, or make system changes, you want protection:

- **Sandboxed Environment:** The container runs in complete isolation from your host machine
- **No Host System Impact:** AI-suggested pnpm installs, file operations, or scripts can't affect your personal system
- **Easy Reset:** If something goes wrong, you can rebuild the container in minutes without affecting your machine
- **Reproducible State:** Every time you rebuild, you get the same clean environment

### 🤖 AI Freedom Without Fear

The devcontainer allows you to confidently let AI assistants:

- **Execute Commands Freely:** Let AI run `pnpm install`, build scripts, or test commands without worrying about side effects
- **Install Packages:** AI can suggest and install experimental packages without polluting your global environment
- **Modify Configuration:** Let AI experiment with settings, configs, or tooling versions safely
- **Run Tests:** Execute test suites that might create temporary files or modify state
- **Try Experimental Changes:** Let AI make bold refactoring suggestions you can test risk-free

### 🔄 Consistency Across Development

- **Identical Environments:** Everyone (including AI) works with the exact same Node version, dependencies, and tools
- **Version Lock:** No "works on my machine" issues caused by different Node or npm versions
- **Extension Parity:** All developers have the same VS Code extensions and settings
- **Reproducible Builds:** AI-assisted changes will behave the same way for all contributors

### 🚀 Faster Onboarding for AI

- **Zero Configuration:** AI can start working immediately without environment setup
- **Pre-installed Tools:** All required dependencies are ready to go
- **Known State:** AI agents can make more accurate suggestions knowing the exact environment
- **Automatic Setup:** The `postCreateCommand` ensures dependencies are always up-to-date

### 💡 Real-World Scenario

Imagine this workflow with AI assistance:

1. **You ask:** "Add support for tracking a new model type"
2. **AI suggests:** Code changes + a new npm package dependency
3. **AI executes:** `pnpm install <new-package>` directly in the container
4. **AI tests:** Runs the extension and verifies it works
5. **Result:** If something breaks, you simply rebuild the container - your host machine is untouched

Without a devcontainer, you'd need to:

- Manually review every command before execution
- Worry about package conflicts with other projects
- Risk system-level changes
- Potentially need to uninstall packages or revert changes

## Manual Local Setup

If you prefer not to use the devcontainer, you can set up the extension locally:

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) 18.x or 20.x
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) (install via `npm install -g pnpm` or `corepack enable`)
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

### Setup Steps

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/rajbos/ai-engineering-fluency.git
   cd ai-engineering-fluency
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

   **Note:** The project uses `pnpm-lock.yaml` for reproducible builds. CI/CD workflows use `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile` to ensure exact dependency versions are installed.

3. **Build the extension:**

   ```bash
   pnpm run compile
   ```

4. **Start developing:**
   - Run `pnpm run watch` for auto-rebuild on changes
   - Press `F5` to launch the Extension Development Host

## Development Workflow

### Build and Compile

```bash
# One-time build
pnpm run compile

# Watch mode (auto-rebuild on changes)
pnpm run watch

# Production build
pnpm run package
```

### Running the Extension

To test and debug the extension in a local VS Code environment:

1. **Install dependencies** (if not already done):

   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

2. **Start watch mode** (automatically recompiles on file changes):

   ```bash
   pnpm run watch
   ```

3. **Press `F5`** in VS Code to launch the Extension Development Host
   - This opens a new VS Code window with the extension running
   - The original window shows debug output and allows you to set breakpoints
   - The launch profile disables both published extension IDs so the dev build does not fight an installed marketplace copy for the same commands

4. **In the Extension Development Host window:**
   - The extension will be active and you'll see the token tracker in the status bar
   - Any changes you make to the code will be automatically compiled (thanks to watch mode)
   - Reload the Extension Development Host window (Ctrl+R or Cmd+R) to see your changes

5. **To view console logs and debug information:**
   - In the Extension Development Host window, open Developer Tools: `Help > Toggle Developer Tools`
   - Check the Console tab for any `console.log` output from the extension

### Creating a VSIX Package

To create an installable VSIX package:

```bash
pnpm exec vsce package
```

### Debugging

- Set breakpoints in `src/extension.ts` or other TypeScript files
- Press `F5` to start debugging
- Open Developer Tools in the Extension Development Host: `Help > Toggle Developer Tools`
- View console output in the Debug Console

## Available Scripts

- `pnpm run lint` - Run ESLint to check code quality
- `pnpm run lint:css` - Run Stylelint to check CSS code quality
- `pnpm run lint:json` - Validate all JSON files in the repository
- `pnpm run check-types` - Run TypeScript type checking
- `pnpm run compile` - Build development version (includes linting and type checking)
- `pnpm run package` - Build production version (optimized)
- `pnpm run watch` - Watch mode for development (auto-recompile on changes)
- `pnpm run watch:tsc` - TypeScript compiler in watch mode
- `pnpm run watch:esbuild` - esbuild bundler in watch mode
- `pnpm test` - Run tests (requires VS Code)
- `pnpm run watch-tests` - Run tests in watch mode

## pnpm and Dependency Management

The project uses **`pnpm-lock.yaml`** for reproducible builds and dependency consistency across all environments.

### Key Files

- **`.npmrc`**: Configures pnpm behavior
- **`pnpm-lock.yaml`**: Lockfile that pins exact dependency versions (committed to the repository)
- **`package.json`**: Defines project dependencies and scripts

### Installation Commands

**RECOMMENDED for day-to-day development:**

- **`pnpm install --frozen-lockfile`**: Clean install from lockfile
  - Requires `pnpm-lock.yaml` to exist
  - Installs exact versions from the lockfile (no modifications)
  - **Use this after pulling changes** to avoid lockfile churn
  - **Used in all CI/CD workflows** for reproducible builds

**Only when adding/updating dependencies:**

- **`pnpm install`**: Install/update dependencies
  - Respects `pnpm-lock.yaml` and may update it
  - Use when adding new dependencies: `pnpm install <package>`
  - Use when updating dependencies: `pnpm install <package>@latest`
  - **After adding dependencies, commit both `package.json` and `pnpm-lock.yaml`**

### Best Practices

1. **Use `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile` for routine development** - This prevents accidental lockfile changes and ensures you have the exact dependency versions
2. **Only use `pnpm install` when intentionally changing dependencies** - This makes dependency updates explicit and trackable
3. **Always commit both files together** - When you modify dependencies, commit both `package.json` and `pnpm-lock.yaml` in the same commit
4. **Don't manually edit `pnpm-lock.yaml`** - Let pnpm manage it automatically

### Why We Use pnpm-lock.yaml

1. **Reproducible Builds**: Ensures all developers and CI/CD get identical dependency versions
2. **Consistency**: Prevents "works on my machine" issues caused by different dependency versions
3. **Security**: Locks down transitive dependencies to prevent supply chain attacks
4. **Performance**: pnpm's content-addressable store makes installs faster with a lockfile

## Code Guidelines

### Project Structure

- **All extension logic** is in `vscode-extension/src/extension.ts` in the `CopilotTokenTracker` class
- **Shared code** (session parsing, token estimation, adapters) lives in the repo-root `src/` folder and is consumed by both the VS Code extension and the CLI
- **Data files** are in JSON format in the repo-root `src/` folder: `tokenEstimators.json`, `modelPricing.json`, `toolNames.json`
- **Webview code** is in `vscode-extension/src/webview/` organized by feature
- **See the repo-root `src/README.md`** for detailed guidance on updating JSON data files

### Development Principles

1. **Minimal Changes:** Only modify files directly needed for your changes
2. **Focused Modifications:** Make surgical, precise changes
3. **Preserve Structure:** Maintain existing code organization
4. **Follow Conventions:** See `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for extension-specific patterns

### Before Submitting

Always run a full build to ensure code quality:

```bash
pnpm run compile
```

### JSON File Validation

The repository includes automatic validation of all JSON files. This ensures that:

- All JSON files contain valid JSON syntax
- JSONC files (JSON with Comments) are properly formatted
- Configuration files (tsconfig, VS Code settings) are valid

**Validated Files:**

- Core JSON data: `src/tokenEstimators.json`, `src/modelPricing.json`, `src/toolNames.json`, `src/customizationPatterns.json`
- Configuration: `package.json`, `tsconfig.json`, `.vscode/*.json`, `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json`
- Schemas: `docs/logFilesSchema/*.json`

**Run JSON validation manually:**

```bash
pnpm run lint:json
```

**Note:** JSON validation is automatically run in CI/CD pipelines to catch syntax errors early.

## Testing

- Test the extension manually in the Extension Development Host (F5)
- Verify token tracking works correctly
- Check that webviews render properly
- Ensure status bar updates as expected
- Run `pnpm test` to execute automated tests
- Ensure all tests pass before submitting changes

## CI/CD

The project includes comprehensive GitHub Actions workflows:

### Build Pipeline

- **Platforms:** Tests on Ubuntu, Windows, and macOS
- **Node Versions:** 18.x and 20.x
- **Checks:** Linting, type checking, compilation, and packaging
- **Badge:** [![Build](https://github.com/rajbos/ai-engineering-fluency/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/rajbos/ai-engineering-fluency/actions/workflows/build.yml)

### What Gets Tested

1. **JSON Validation:** All JSON and JSONC files are validated for correct syntax
2. **Linting:** ESLint checks for code quality issues
3. **Type Checking:** TypeScript validates all types
4. **Compilation:** esbuild creates the production bundle
5. **Packaging:** VSIX package is created and validated
6. **Extension Tests:** VS Code extension tests run in CI

All builds must pass these checks before merging.

## Pre-Release Checklist

Run `pnpm run pre-release` to validate the version and compile.

- [ ] Version bumped in `package.json`
- [ ] `pnpm run compile` completed successfully
- [ ] Commit and push to main branch
- [ ] Trigger Release workflow (GitHub UI → Actions → Release → Run workflow)

The workflow handles everything else: tagging, building, testing, creating the GitHub release, publishing to the marketplace, and updating the changelog.

## Release Process

The project uses a fully automated release pipeline via GitHub Actions.

### One-Step Release (Recommended)

1. **Update the version** in `package.json`
2. **Commit and push** to the main branch
3. **Go to GitHub Actions** → Release workflow → **Run workflow**

The workflow inputs:
- `create_tag` — Creates a git tag from the `package.json` version (default: true)
- `publish_marketplace` — Publishes to the VS Code Marketplace and Open VSX (default: true)

The workflow automatically:

1. Creates a version tag (e.g., `v0.0.19`)
2. Generates release notes from merged PRs (using `.github/release.yml` categories)
3. Updates `CHANGELOG.md` in the VSIX package so the extension ships with current notes
4. Runs the full build pipeline (lint, type-check, compile, test)
5. Creates a GitHub Release with the VSIX attached
6. Publishes to the VS Code Marketplace (using the `VSCE_PAT` secret)
7. Publishes to the Open VSX Registry (using the `OPEN_VSX_TOKEN` secret)
8. Opens a PR to sync `CHANGELOG.md` in the repository

> **Security:** Only users with repository write access can trigger the `workflow_dispatch`. The `VSCE_PAT` secret must be configured in repository settings (Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions). Create a PAT at https://dev.azure.com with the "Marketplace (Publish)" scope. The `OPEN_VSX_TOKEN` secret must also be configured; create a token at https://open-vsx.org/user-settings/tokens.

### Tag-Based Release (Build Only)

Pushing a version tag (e.g., `git push origin v0.0.19`) triggers the build and creates a GitHub release, but does **not** publish to the marketplaces. Use the workflow dispatch for the full pipeline.

### Manual Changelog Sync

To manually sync the changelog with all GitHub release notes:

```bash
pnpm run sync-changelog
```

Or trigger the **Sync Release Notes** workflow from the Actions tab.

### Manual Publish (Fallback)

If you need to re-publish manually (e.g., after a marketplace upload failure):

```powershell
.\publish.ps1 -VsixPath ".\ai-engineering-fluency-0.0.19.vsix"
```

## Submitting Changes

1. **Fork the repository** on GitHub
2. **Create a feature branch** from `main`
3. **Make your changes** in the devcontainer
4. **Test thoroughly** using the Extension Development Host
5. **Run `pnpm run compile`** to ensure everything builds
6. **Commit with clear messages** describing your changes
7. **Push to your fork** and create a Pull Request

### Pull Request Guidelines

- Provide a clear description of what your PR does
- Reference any related issues
- Include screenshots/videos for UI changes
