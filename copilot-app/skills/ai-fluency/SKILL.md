# AI fluency canvas

The `ai-fluency-canvas` plugin provides a canvas with `canvasId` `ai-fluency`.

- To show the stats, open it: `open_canvas({ canvasId: "ai-fluency", instanceId: "ai-fluency" })`.
- To answer questions in chat, open the canvas as above, then call
  `invoke_canvas_action({ instanceId: "ai-fluency", actionName: "get_summary" })`.
  It returns the cached snapshot's aggregate numbers and never runs the CLI.
- Only pass `{ "topSessions": 1-25 }` when the user asks about specific sessions: it adds session titles (often the
  user's first prompt) and project names to the result.
- To update the numbers, call the `refresh` action. It runs in the background and can take several
  minutes; pass `{ "wait": true }` only when the user wants to wait for fresh numbers.
- If `get_summary` returns `available: false`, no snapshot exists yet: tell the user the first run
  parses all local session logs and takes a few minutes, then start a `refresh`.

The canvas reads local session logs and uploads nothing itself, but whatever `get_summary` returns becomes part of
this conversation and is sent to the model.
